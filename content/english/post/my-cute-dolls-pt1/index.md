## Introduction
Hello! As you guys know, I really love dolls! :) I've been working on the last year to finish those dolls of my tulpas, so they'll have a physical representation and it'll be easier to talk with them and have fun! <3

It's been CRAZY! It was very fun learning for this hobby and now I'm hooked! But it was also so time consuming and money consuming? Haha, I feel like I grown insane.

Anyways, let's show you the dolls and their new cute outfits! Each of them has 3 outfits! :) I don't show Abby's first outfit as she didn't wear it for quite some time.

## 1. Abby
Abby is the first ever doll I made! I did her faceup, it took me a couple of tries to get it perfect. It still has flaws but I still love it so much. She's a cool and elegant lady. She loves the stars and gothic lolita fashion.

This is her second outfit, looking very soft and cute! :) I love this outfit a lot. This wig is also her second wig. <abbr title="I don't know">IDK</abbr> if I prefer this one or the former one haha.

This outfit is her newest outfit! She looks like a gothic mage and i absolutely ADORE it!!! <3
Please forgive the lighting, I was too lazy to fully edit it.

Here's Ciel and Abby together in their newest outfits:

## 2. Ciel
Ciel's head I purchased on Yahoo Auction. I tried so hard to get it and I'm so happy I did! No. Matter. The. Cost. She's such a lovely girl, gentle and energetic! She loves Abby to death and will do everything for her! :)

She loves elegant and traditional outfits, which makes her look like the princess she is! :D

This is her first outfit with her new wig, she looks absolutely ethereal and princess-like. She's gorgeous.

Her second outfit is so elegant and cute! she looks like Yuki Oona! She's such a princess here!

Last but not least, Ciel in her last outfit, her old wig gives it a girl-next-door vibes. She looks cute and approachable. I absolutely adore how that outfit looks on her. Volks know how to make their outfits! <3

## Last but not least, Elly!
Our last bby, the youngest and baddass Elly! She's a genius who's already working at the largest Cyber Security company at the world besides being just 19. She finished college when she was 17 in Programming and Cyber Security major.

She's cool and sassy, she loves her sister ver much and her two friends, Abby and Ciel. She seems aloof and uninterested, but if someone shares the same love as her for puzzles and chess, she'll immediately light up. 

Her first outfit is cool yet cute. Elly can be embarrased at times to wear it, but she loves it none-the-less. It is coloured in purple and black, her favourite colours.

Her second outfit gives Cyberpunk, Rain Code vibes. Which Elly loves very much. I didn't take much photos with this one for some reason. I was excited to try the next outfit that I had no time.

Her last outfit is also from Volks. It might look like something Abby will wear as it is quite gothic. But it has a cool and baddass charm, in compared to Abby's elegant and lolita style. It's one of my absolute favourite outfits. The amount of details is crazy. I might film a video soon of dressing those dolls up so you could see how well made and detailed it is! :)
