## Introduction
There are many times I realise that stuff that are obvious to me aren’t obvious to others. (To be fair, a lot of shit that’s obvious to you isn’t obvious to me, <abbr title="Laugh out loud">LOL</abbr>!) When those moments hit, my brain goes: “let’s spread my knowledge around so more people will be aware!” 

This struck me yesterday when I spoke with a friend about Tiktok and brainrot from Tiktok.

Me, like the major douche I am, went: “uninstall TikTok!”

“How will I watch my favourite tiktokers then?”

At that moment, I was struck with a major “oh” moment. 

Oh. People aren’t aware of Tiktok frontends... Or frontends for social medias in general.

So yes, I’m writing a blog post about it so I could share it with people. Don’t worry, normies, I got chu! I’ll save you from doomscrolling!

This post is going to have links, both for the project source codes + instances I use. I am planning to self host those front-end at some point, I just procrastinate a lot.

## What the fuck is a front-ended social media?!
Frontend alternatives for social media platforms are designed to provide a more privacy-friendly and ad-free experience. These alternatives often use the APIs or scrape data from the original social media services but present it in a cleaner, more user-friendly format.

These alternatives aim to enhance user privacy and reduce intrusive elements like ads and tracking scripts.

## Summary
Probably nobody but my friends will read this shit. But if you’ve read this and came out with new knowledge, I did my job!~

I would recommend to create a list of the usernames of your favourite content creators on social medias, keep it in a document file, then search them on the frontends. You can also save their frontend instance link on that document and every once in a while check for new content.

It’s slower to consume content that way, but you won’t be as stimulated and *allegedly* live a more peaceful life.

Enjoy!~ See you at some point!
