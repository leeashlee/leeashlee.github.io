## Products Review

[My Melody Cushion Foundation](https://amzn.to/46h9TPP) - I love this foundation! It's perfect for daily use as it's not too heavy and covers my skin perfectly. It fits my skin tone, which is a HUGE bonus for me because I'm so pale, it's hard for me to find a foundation.

- *Coverage* - light to medium.
- *Long lasting* - Yes, make sure to use powder.
- *Dry or Moisturising* - Moisturising. I'm not too sure if it fits oily skin.
- *Color diversity* - 3 shades (one My Melody, two kuromis). It only suits for white people.

*Overall:* 4/5!

[Better Than Palette My Melody](https://amzn.to/3ZNtkxn) - It's a bright peach palette, perfect for daily use. The palette is very pigmented and includes both matts, shimmers and glitters. You gotta be careful of fallout.

- *Pigment* - Super Strong.
- *Fallout* - Yes.
- *Colour Story* - A bit basic.
- *Type of shades* - Diverse, both matt, shimmer and glitter.
- *Does it suit for all skin tones?* - It mostly suits for white people, if you have black skin, test if it can fit.

*Overall:* 4.8/5

[Better Than Palette Kuromi](https://amzn.to/3QadE40) - It's a palette perfect for when you wanna go out. It can be used daily too, just be a bit careful. The fallout is more extreme in this palette, so be careful. It includes matts, shimmers and glitters.

- *Pigment* - Super Strong.
- *Fallout* - Yes.
- *Colour Story* - A bit basic. The colours combination here is unique though.
- *Type of shades* -  Diverse, both matt, shimmer and glitter.
- *Does it suit for all skin tones?* - It mostly suits for white people, if you have black skin, test if it can fit.

*Overall:* 4.8/5

[Dewy-ful Water Tint](https://amzn.to/3RSaZgw) - Super cute colours which looks glossy when first applied. If you wanna keep the gloss, you gotta reapply during the day.

- *Long lasting* - You gotta reapply during the day.
- *Dry or Moisturising* - Moisturising.

*Overall:* 4/5
