## Introduction
Mostly a filler post before my bigger content will finally be ready. I love talking about makeup at times and I made some makeup videos in the past so I'm happy to talk about something I enjoy. I'll share links, they're not sponsored though, I promise.

## face
### Makeup base
[Canmake Skin Gel UV](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=255792) - It has SPF50+ and PA++++. It's comfortable on the face and isn't sticky like other facial sunscreens and bases. I enjoy using it when I put makeup on or I just put it when I go out to protect my face from UV light. 

### Concealer
- [Tarte Shape Tape](https://tartecosmetics.com/shop/shape-tape-concealer-836.html) - It's as good as everyone claims. It's super bright so I use it under my eyes to add glow to my face.
- [Revolution Concealer & Define](https://www.revolutionbeauty.com/intl/en/makeup/face/concealer/makeup-revolution-conceal-and-define-concealer/makeup-revolution-conceal--define-concealer.html) - It's hard to find concealer for my porcelain and yellow toned skin, this one works for me, although it's slight pinkish. I use it to cover imperfections in my face.

### Foundation
[Bourjois Always Fabulous Full Coverage Foundation](beaute-test.com/always-fabulous-full-coverage-foundation-bourjois.php) - For my daily routine, I don't use foundation because it can get heavy and my skin isn't too bad. However, it's one of the few foundations which isn't too dark or too pink. It's perfect for my skin.

### Powder
- [Innisfree No-Sebum Mineral Color Powder](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Anti-Shrink-Prevention-Anti-Crush-Anti-Crumble-Adsorption/dp/B07SDZ84N1/ref=d_pd_vtp_sccl_2_1/356-2962008-2068344) - This powder has no sebum, which is perfect to use if you have a dry skin yet you want to keep certain areas in place. My skin is very textured, so I only put powder on areas I want to be Matt. Such as under the eyes, the T-zone and the chin. It has a nice and natural smell that reminds me of spa and it's very gentle.
- [Benefit Hello Happy Velvet Powder Foundation](https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/en-us/product/hello-happy-velvet-powder-foundation?&sku=FM165) - It's a great and beautiful powder! I use it the same way I use the Innisfree powder. It gives a velvet-smooth texture and it's light and beautiful. The link lacks most of the shades, at least the ones I've seen at the store I purchased at.

## Blush
- [Canmake Lip&Cheek Gel](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Can-Make-Cheek-0-05-1-5g/dp/B01H2TC3BU/) - It's a cream blush which is vibrant yet very fitting for daily use. You can also use it on your lips if you desire. I really like to use it, especially on my lips because of the vibrant color.
- [Canmake Cream Cheek](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=235814) - It's another cream blush by Canmake. I purchased the pink shade because I always wanted to have one. It's super cute and is good whenever I want to make a sweet and kawaii look.
- [Cezanne Blush and Highlighter](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=271796) - This is a blush and a highlighter, I use it on my daily. The blush is vibrant and on the perfect shade for me, the highlighter is glowy but isn't too shiny. It has glitter, which I personally love. But if you don't love glitter, then it's not for you.

## Eyebrows
- [Cezanne Nose & Eyebrow Powder](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=253252) - It's a palette perfect for contour and eyebrows. I don't do contour because it makes my face even uglier than it usually is. For eyebrows though? It's natural and beautiful. It has 3 shades, I use the lightest part at the end close to the nose, the middle part for the rest of the brow, and the darkest part at the edges. I have full eyebrows, so I don't need to fill them too much.
- [Heavy Rotation Coloring Eyebrow](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=286050) - It's a brow mascara that keeps my brows in place, it also brightens my brows which blends them when I have mesh on my hair.
- [Heavy Rotation Brow Pencil and Brush](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=188264) - It's a great brow pencil, when you put it on the skin, it stays. I like using it to fill holes that I have. If you want a brow pencil, I recommend this one.

## Eyes

### Eyeshadow
- [Canmake Perfect Stylist Eyes (14)](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=224264) - Japanese eyeshadows are super vibrant and bright and they're full of glitter. I really love it. Since the eyes are the point of my makeup, that style fits me. The eyeshadows are a bit creamy, so applying with your fingers or with a sprayed brush will make the shadow more pigmented. It can be layered so you can use regularly if you want.
- [Canmake Silky Souffle Eyes (11, M04, 04)](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=231510)

### Eyeliner
- Using the darkest shades at my eyeshadow
- [Cezanne Drawing Double Eyelid Eyeliner](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Cezanne-Double-Eyeliner-Shadow-Highlight/dp/B0B9JZBDH1/ref=sr_1_3) when going through natural look

### Mascara
- [Canmake Quick Lash Curler](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Canmake-Quick-Curler-Transparent-Mascara/dp/B07SD9R731/ref=sr_1_1) - At first I was really surprised because the brush is different then the brands on the west. However, the brush catches the lashes really well. I purchased a brown one for when I make daily and natural looks.
- [Essence The False Lashes Mascara](https://www.amazon.com/essence-Lashes-Mascara-Extreme-Cruelty/dp/B01JZQYNN4) - It looks like how the name says it is. It's gorgeous and full. It does feel heavy so I only use it on special occasions.
- [Tarte Maneater](https://tartecosmetics.com/shop/maneater-mascara-856.html) for lower lashline

### Gliter
[Cezanne Glow Liquid Liner](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Cezanne-Liquid-Glitter-Teardrop-Multicolor/dp/B0BQN49WLQ/ref=sr_1_1) - It's a glitter liner which you can use on your eyes to make areas you want shiny and glittery. I put a bit and then dab with my fingers, it is glittery so the glitter spreads around often. It adds a bit of shininess whenever your makeup is a bit dull.

## Lips
- [DHC Lip Cream](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=303987) - I use it as a base to keep my lips for longer or keep them moist when I put drying lipsticks.
- [Kylie Cosmetics Bare Lip-kit](https://kyliecosmetics.com/en-il/products/matte-lip-kit?variant=43927622123762) - I purchased it at the Duty Free and I really enjoy it. It's big in comparison to other lips products The lip liner is perfection, the lipsticks are drying and it can get uncomfortable, however, it stays for a really long time.
- Cezanne Watery Tint Lip [01](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=222347) & [P1](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=284346) - I use them all the time! The colors are vibrant and shiny yet are perfect to use on the daily. The only downfall is that it's not staying for long.
- [Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lipcolor](https://www.revlon.com/lips/liquid-lipstick/ultra-hd-matte-lipcolor) - I love it, it's velvety and comfortable on the lips. The shade I have goes well with Cezanne Watery Tint Lip 01. I love using it when I do a more "mature" makeup look.

## Setting Spray
[Kosé - Make Keep Mist EX](https://www.cosme.com/products/detail.php?product_id=223357) - It has a nice smell and makes my face look more hydrated after all the powders I've put. xD I think it keeps my makeup for longer, but I just love how my makeup looks better after applying it.
