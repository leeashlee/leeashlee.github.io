## Introduction
Hello! As you guys know, I really love dolls! :) I've been working on the last year to finish those dolls of my tulpas, so they'll have a physical representation and it'll be easier to talk with them and have fun! <3

It's been CRAZY! It was very fun learning for this hobby and now I'm hooked! But it was also so time consuming and money consuming? Haha, I feel like I grown insane.

Anyways, let's show you the dolls and their new cute outfits! Each of them has 3 outfits! :) I don't show Abby's first outfit as she didn't wear it for quite some time.

## 1. Abby


## 2. Ciel

## Last but not least, Elly!
