I'm alive, I think. I'm mostly bored and lonely but that's normal.

I'm fine, except feeling aimless and lonely. Mostly frustrated I can't beat Sisters VS Sisters final boss and too lazy to grind! >:

Cheat Engine doesn't work either so that's sad. ):

Off I go to figure out Cheat Engine and run Neptunia! :)
