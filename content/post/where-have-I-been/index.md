Hello everyone!
I'm doing fine! I took a break of making meaningful content because school started and the war in my country is still going on.
All the worries regarding the state of my country, the grief of losing a student I knew to the war and losing couple of friends due to discovered anti-semitism really affected me hard.

I'm lucky and fortunate in this situation, so I'm trying to keep myself optimistic, but I sometimes can't help but dwell on this all. I decided to focus my energy on school work and video games instead of making blog content.

I do have couple of ideas so just wait for when I'll have the energy! :)
